1) Change config/settings.inc.php to use the new database connection info.
2) Do a find/replace on the database dump, replace 'doubletuff.com' with the new hostname. Import the dump.

UPDATING YOUR DATABASE
Log into cPanel, then go to "PHPMyAdmin" and log into your PrestaShop database. Go to the table "ps_configuration" and locate the records for PS_SHOP_DOMAIN and PS_SHOP_DOMAIN_SSL. Change these to the new domain name. Check the configuration table for any other entries that contain the old domain name and change accordingly.

UPDATING YOUR CONFIG SETTINGS
Via FTP or the file manager in cPanel, modify the PHP file /config/settings.inc.php. Look for the entry for PS_BASE_URI__ and modify as necessary. For a shop located in the root, it should read:

?
1
define('__PS_BASE_URI__', '/');
